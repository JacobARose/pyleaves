DEPRECATED directory created 11/15/20 by Jacob A Rose


This is meant to be a temporary (lol) location for old scripts to be placed prior to deletion, in order to avoid accidentally deleting any necessary or useful bits of code contained inside.


Ideally, scripts will be placed in a location within a similar directory structure as their original location, to preserve logical context.

e.g.

We moved

pyleaves/pyleaves/pipelines/testing_pipeline_1.ipynb

to

pyleaves/pyleaves/DEPRECATED/pipelines/testing_pipeline_1.ipynb
